# Loan-Approval-Prediction 
Loan Status Prediction - Binary Classification

It is a binary classification problem where we need to predict whether a customer should get a loan or not on the basis of the information filled by the customer in his loan application. A Housing Company wants to automate the loan approval process and therefore wants us to build a predictive model based on the information given by their customers.
